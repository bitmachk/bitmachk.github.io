			<p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a Blockchain.</p>
			<p>Bitcoin was invented by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto and released as open-source software in 2009 (Wiki, 2018).</p>
