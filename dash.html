			<p>Dash (formerly known as Darkcoin and XCoin) is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. On top of Bitcoin's feature set, it currently offers instant transactions (InstantSend), private transactions (PrivateSend) and operates a self-governing and self-funding model that enables the Dash network to pay individuals and businesses to perform work that adds value to the network. Dash's decentralized governance and budgeting system makes it a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).</p>
			<p>Dash was originally released as XCoin (XCO) on January 18, 2014. On January 28, the name was changed to "Darkcoin". On March 25, 2015, Darkcoin was rebranded as "Dash." Dash is a portmanteau of "Digital Cash" (Wiki, 2018).</p>
